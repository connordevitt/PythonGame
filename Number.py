# Let's start by writing the basic structure of the "Guess the Number" game.

def guess_the_number():
    import random

    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    
    print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    # The game loop
    while True:
        try:
            # Player makes a guess
            guess = int(input("Make a guess: "))

            # Check the guess
            if guess < number_to_guess:
                print("Too low. Try again!")

                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")

# Let's not run the game here, as it requires interactive input which isn't possible in this environment.

# Next, we can add features like limiting the number of guesses, providing hints, etc.
# Tell me to print "next" or "continue" to add more features or refine the code! ðŸ˜Š
